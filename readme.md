# Intro

Python's traditional runtime execution model: source code you type is translated to byte code, which then will be run by Python Virtual Machine. Your code is automatically compiled, but then it is interpreted.

The Python interpreter is a program that runs the Python source code you write. Source code is/are statements you write for your program - it consists of text(byte code) in textfiles that ends with .py extension. Bytecode is the lower level from your program after Python compiles it. Python automatically stores the bytecode in the files with .py extension.

After the code you type in, the Python Virtual Machine (PVM) - the runtime engine of Python interprets your bytecode (compiled byte code).



<h3> Object types </h3>

Python programs can be decomposed into modules, statements, expressions and objects as follow:

- Programs are composed of modules.
- Modules contain statements.
- Statements contain expressions.
- Expressions create and process objects.

In typical Python programs most of this grunt work goes away. Because Python provides powerful object types as an intrinsic part of the language, there is usually no need to code object implementation before you start solving problems. 

<i>Program units</i> such as functions,modules and classes are objects in Python- they are created with statements and expressions such as <b>def,class, import</b> and <b>lambda</b>. 



<i><mark><b>In python explicit is better than implicit and simple is better than complex.</b></mark> </i>



<h3> Debugging </h3>

Read the error message and go fix the tagged line. 

Another way debugging your code is to insert <i>print</i> statements. 

Furthermore you can use <i>IDE GUI debuggers </i>which is a sort of point-and-click debugging support.



# Q&A

1. <b>What are the six main reasons that people choose to use Python?</b>

   Software quality, developer productivity, program portability, support libraries, component integration, and simple enjoyment. Of these, the quality and productivity themes seem to be the main reasons that people choose to use Python

2.  <b>Name four notable companies or organizations using Python today.</b>

   Google, Industrial Light & Magic, EVE Online, Jet Propulsion Labs, Maya, ESRI, and many more. Almost every organization doing software development uses Python in some fashion, whether for long-term strategic product development or for short-term tactical tasks such as testing and system administration.

   

3. <b>Why might you not want to use Python in an application?</b>

   Python’s downside is performance: it won’t run as quickly as fully compiled languages like C and C++. On the other hand, it’s quick enough for most applications, and typical Python code runs at close to  speed anyhow because it invokes linked-in C code in the interpreter. If speed is critical, compiled extensions are available for number-crunching parts of an application.

4. <b>What can you do with Python? </b>

   You can use Python for nearly anything you can do with a computer, from website development and gaming to robotics and spacecraft control.

5. <b>What’s the significance of the Python import this statement? </b>

   import this triggers an Easter egg inside Python that displays some of the design philosophies underlying the language. You’ll learn how to run this statement in the next chapter.

6. <b>Why does “spam” show up in so many Python examples in books and on the Web? </b>

   “Spam” is a reference from a famous Monty Python skit in which people trying to order food in a cafeteria are drowned out by a chorus of Vikings singing about spam. Oh, and it’s also a common variable name in Python scripts....
